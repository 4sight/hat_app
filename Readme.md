1. Read this article on Gulp - http://goo.gl/cZ3bHS

2. You'll be working in groups of 2 as follows:
Brendan Stern & Katlyn Gabor
Josh Daniels & Taylor Smith
Terry Ross & Jonathan Dickerson
Michael Powell  & Thach Lee
Greeley Dawson & Laura Patti
Your task is to create a repository and push to it. You only need to include a Markdown (.md) file and write something up about a fictional product you would create if you had time. Write at least 10 different bullet points about possible features, bugs etc that you might experience. Have fun with this but make sure it makes sense. Then your partner will fork the repo, make some suggestions and then create a pull request.
Make sure you both create repos and you both fork each others repos
Make sure you make changes and submit a pull request
You will need to accept/deny the pull request (there should be no open requests by tomorrow)
Also make sure you are working on a branch and not master.
3. Create a simple Yeoman project using Bourbon & Neat. Set up a basic page that is in line with - http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/. I'm looking to make sure you understand how to include Neat on your page and make sure you understand how Neat works with layout. It does not need to be responsive, but bonus points for those that can figure it out :)


When you are finished, make a note here with a "Yes, I read the article" or "No, I didn't finish the article". Also link to your group project repo and your Neat project repo.
